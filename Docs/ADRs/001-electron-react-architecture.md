# ADR-001: Electron + React Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Raeen Launcher needs to be a cross-platform desktop application with access to system resources while providing a modern, responsive user interface. The application requires:

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Native system integration (file system, processes, hardware monitoring)
- Modern, responsive UI with complex interactions
- Real-time updates and data streaming
- Background services and system monitoring
- Integration with multiple game platforms and their APIs

### Technology Options Considered

1. **Native Applications** (C++/C#/.NET/Swift)
   - Pros: Maximum performance, full system access
   - Cons: Platform-specific code, longer development time, larger team required

2. **Web-based Solutions** (PWA/Browser Extension)
   - Pros: Easy deployment, web technologies
   - Cons: Limited system access, browser security restrictions

3. **Cross-platform Frameworks**
   - **Electron**: Web technologies in native wrapper
   - **Tauri**: Rust backend with web frontend
   - **Flutter Desktop**: Dart-based framework

## Decision

We will use **Electron with React** as the primary architecture for Raeen Launcher.

### Architecture Components

- **Main Process**: Node.js environment for system integration
- **Renderer Process**: Chromium with React for UI
- **Preload Scripts**: Secure bridge between main and renderer
- **IPC Communication**: Type-safe inter-process communication

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Rapid Development**: Leverage existing web development skills and ecosystem
- **Cross-platform**: Single codebase for all platforms
- **Rich UI**: Full access to modern web technologies and React ecosystem
- **System Integration**: Node.js provides comprehensive system access
- **Community Support**: Large community, extensive documentation
- **Ecosystem**: Access to npm packages and React component libraries
- **Development Tools**: Excellent debugging and development experience

### Negative

- **Performance Overhead**: Higher memory usage compared to native apps
- **Bundle Size**: Larger application size due to Chromium
- **Security Considerations**: Need careful handling of Node.js access
- **Platform Consistency**: May not feel 100% native on each platform

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient state management
- **Security**: Use context isolation, disable node integration in renderer, secure preload scripts
- **Bundle Size**: Optimize dependencies, implement auto-updater for differential updates
- **Native Feel**: Use platform-specific UI patterns and system integrations where possible

### Technical Implications

- Need robust IPC architecture for main-renderer communication
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Design for offline-first capabilities where possible
- Plan for auto-update system and crash reporting
- Consider memory management for long-running sessions

This decision enables rapid development while providing the system-level access required for a comprehensive gaming launcher.
